# 📊 Employee Analytics Dashboard – Excel Project

Welcome to my Employee Analytics Dashboard! This project showcases a comprehensive analysis of employee data using Microsoft Excel. Through advanced functions and pivot tables, I’ve developed interactive insights into workforce structure, compensation trends, and operational metrics.

## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard analyzes a dataset of 100 employees across multiple departments including HR, IT, Finance, Operations, and Marketing. The data spans several years and includes attributes such as:

- Age and Department
- Salary and Bonus Percentage
- Hours Worked
- Leaves Taken
- Joining Date

Using Excel formulas and dynamic tables, key performance indicators (KPIs) are calculated to support business decisions and workforce evaluations.

## 🧮 Key Features

### ✅ Pivot Table Reports
- **Department Breakdown:** Count of employees, total salary by department, and leave distributions.
- **Age Groups:** Employee count by age range (18–27, 28–37, etc.).
- **Monthly Analysis:** Summarized statistics across different months and years.

### ✅ Calculated KPIs
- **Total Employees:** 100
- **Total Salary:** 921,668
- **Average Age:** ~38 years
- **Average Leaves Taken:** ~9 per employee
- **Department Stats:** HR and IT departments show the highest headcounts and salary totals.

### ✅ Excel Functions Utilized
- `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `VLOOKUP`, and conditional formulas like `COUNTIF`
- Custom calculations for bonus allocation and efficiency metrics

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I deepened my experience in:

- Transforming raw HR data into actionable visual reports
- Using advanced Excel features to build data models
- Applying analytical thinking for workforce performance metrics
- Communicating data stories through dashboards

## 📂 File Structure

- `Employees.xlsx`: Main file containing employee data across multiple sheets
  - `Sheet1`: Raw employee information
  - `Sheet2`: VLOOKUP and ID mapping
  - `Sheet4`: Source data and function examples
  - `Pivot Table`: Aggregated reports and calculated KPIs

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Export insights to Power BI for richer visualizations
- Connect Excel to real-time data sources using Power Query
- Automate data updates via macros or scripting
